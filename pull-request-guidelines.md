5. Separate the list title and the short description with a dash.
   
> [!NOTE]
> Descripe the content in your list objectively in the short description, instead of the list itself.

> Do not use a tagline or marketing blurb as the short description.
> 
> Do not contain the list title in the short description.

## Homework

In order to help the [Awesome][repo] list self-sustaining, please complete the homework before you submit the pull request:

Review at least two other [pull request]s before you open a pull request to add your list in the [Awesome][repo] list. You can make comments at the following aspects:

- Prioritize unreviewed pull requests.
- Make comments on reviewed pull requests.

> [!NOTE]
> You must point out mistakes or improvement suggestions in your comments.
> 
> A comment like "looks good" or "approved" does not count.
> 
> A comment on lint violation is allowed, but it does not count as a review.

> [!TIP]
> Look at previous pull request reviews for inspiration.
